Run Python JSON benchmarks to find the fastest module that can be used as a drop-in replacement of the `json` standard one.

Benchmarks are run from a [GitHub workflow](.github/workflows/benchmark.yml).

See the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file for exact modules being tested, and [which imports](bench-json.py#L9) are being used in the benchmark script.
